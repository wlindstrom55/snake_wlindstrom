 * our Snake class will be responsible for very little. 
 * Its job will be to store data about where our snake is
 * and which direction it is heading, and very little else.
 * It will not be responsible for keeping track of how many points the player has.
 * It will not be responsible for printing anything to the terminal.
 * It will not even be responsible for working out when the snake has bashed into itself and died.
