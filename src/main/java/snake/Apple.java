 * Our Apple class will be responsible for even less than our Snake.
 * All it will store is an apple’s location on the board.
 * You could argue that Apple doesn’t even need to be a class,
 * and that the apple’s location could just be a simple variable inside Game.
 * I personally think it’s still good to have an Apple class -
 * partly for consistency with the fact that we have a Snake class,
 * and partly because I can easily see us adding more properties to Apple,
 * for example making each apple worth a variable number of points.
